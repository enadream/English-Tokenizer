# English Tokenizer and Parser by Enadream

This is a rule-based chatbot application developed solely by me as a full-stack developer. The main objective of the application is to parse input sentences morphologically and syntactically, generating question sentences based on a rule-based approach. I implemented the application entirely in C++ using only the standard library, without relying on any external libraries. The chatbot effectively tokenizes words within the input string, conducts morphological analysis, and determines their classification among 10 different word types, including nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections, auxiliary verbs, and determiners. Furthermore, the application can handle suffixed words, irregular verbs, and singular-plural nouns separately.
